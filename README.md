# CCSO Nameserver

The CCSO nameserver was an early form of database search on the Internet. 
In its most common form, it was used as an electronic "Phone Book" to
lookup information such as telephone numbers and email addresses. Today,
this service has largely been replaced by LDAP. It was used mainly in the
early-to-middle 1990s. [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCSO_Nameserver)

This repository contains a working version of the original CCSO nameserver
(aka *"Qi"*) developed by Steven Domer at University of Illinois in '93. I
salvaged the source code from some long forgotten FTP server. Then I stuck it
in a CentOS Docker Container, and I smashed it with a hammer until *gcc* cried
uncle and submitted to compiling without errors.

The fruits of this labor can be seen here:

This is probably the only example of a running CCSO server left on the open
web. I have searched extensively and have not been able to find any others.
